## Installation
The Null Project requires the installation of the following npm packages: 
- express
- MySql2
- sequelize
- express-handlebars
- AWS-SDK
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- connect-session-sequelize

## Usage

As an author/researcher who struggles to publish my null findings, I need a website/app that allows me to put my work up for the world to see, so that other qualified individuals can read and review my work. Typically, when a user comes up with a hypothesis, doing ‘A’ will produce a result of ‘B’. However, there are instances where doing ‘A’ will produce a null result, which simply means that the result was not the expected result or it does not support the hypothesis.
